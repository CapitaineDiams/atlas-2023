	"description": "Done as a Romanian unique way of participating in the fuck spez protest, the impaled spez drawing was made in reference to Vlad the Impaler's punishments. A first drawing was created on the main flag, however, it was soon censored by Reddit admins.\n\nOn what was thought to be the last hours of the event, a second impaled spez was drawn on the second flag, replacing the previous drawing of a Ciuca»ô beer bottle. During its creation, the Reddit admins censored the \"Spez\" text sign continuously, delaying its construction. As the event did not end that day, the drawing was eventually fully censored, though its reconstruction was tried several times by members of the community (including during the whiteout with only a white and black outline).",
